# NumberGuessingGame  
This repository contains a simple Number Guessing Game built in Java as part of my internship at @CodeCasa. The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts. It's a fun and interactive way to practice Java programming skills.

Key Features:
Random number generation.
User input validation.
Real-time feedback on guesses.
Limited chances to add challenge.
Built with Java, Swing, and JavaFX for the GUI.
